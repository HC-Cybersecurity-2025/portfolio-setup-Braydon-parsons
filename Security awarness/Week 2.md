Social Engineering attacks - Using trickery to convince and steal passwords
phishing - Commonly used attack by sending a email claiming to be a legitamite business
Hoaxes - Using false warning to scare users

I’d say this was very useful as being able to see in real time how effective a person's password is really puts into perspective how easy cracking an average password is. I think seeing how easy a persons password is to crack would be eye opening for most people but at the same time most just have the mindset (It doesn’t matter why would anyone want my password or data). It’s that very mindset that makes it so easy for million people data to get stolen every year buy you can’t really blame them because trying to reminder very long password for every account you have or make is not very easy.

Reflecation
I'd say I'm going to start working on my own passwords and putting more thought into them. Instead of just thinking of something easy toput in so i don't forget.
