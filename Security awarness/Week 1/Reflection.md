More and more people are using the internet every day and therefore there's more chances of people out there trying to attack and steal that information. They're always scheming and plotting new ways to do it so even if you figure out one way then they'll come right back with another right away.



   one of the hardest challenge to prevent cyber attacks is that fact the people are not knowledgeable on them to begin with. Especially the older generations. Specifically the generation that didn't grow up with technology and aren't used to the idea that people online are malicious and would have no problem with stealing from them. People don't know the easiest tricks in the book like phishing with fake email, texts and phone calls. Not to mention they can pose as harmless small time organization promising to help the less fortunate and ask you for money. They can also post listings online for things like vehicles like on facebook market place and then ask for things such as your phone number which they can then steal from you and use it to try and scam other people. They can also try and pull the same thing with your email. The current day and age the biggest problem is simply people not informing themselves on these matters leading to them and other poeple they know getting hurt in the process.
